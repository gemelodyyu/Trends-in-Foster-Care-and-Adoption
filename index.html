                <h2>Trends in Foster Care  2010 - 2019</h2>
                <hr>
                <p class="lead">Foster care in America is becoming more and more of a pressing issue on communities
                    around the country. State agencies are becoming more and more saturated with children requiring foster care
                    with not enough families to take in the children affected by separation.</p>
                <p class="lead">Every state is responsible for the administration of their own foster system; some
                    states even subcontract this out to other community organizations. The data reported is by state by year.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="lead">Using a regression analysis from Sklearn we are going to develop a model to predict
                        what the foster care needs will be 5, 10, and 20 years from now. We will be looking at
                        predicting the number of children in care as well as TPR predictions for the future as that can
                        also be used to estimate group home needs for children that age out of the foster system without
                        being adopted. We hope to be able to perform this prediction by state but may only be able to
                        view the prediction in aggregate.</p>
