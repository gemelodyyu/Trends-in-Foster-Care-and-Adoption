# Finding Trends in Finding Forever Homes


## Background 


Foster care in America is becoming more and more of a pressing issue on communities around the country. State agencies are becoming more and more saturated with children requiring foster care with not enough families to take in the children affected by separation. 


Our goal is to be able to predict the future need of foster families in The Midwestern United States based on data obtained from 2010-2019.


## Our Motivations


* Resources available for foster families are limited already; by projecting out the need in the future agencies can get a “heads up” as to what resources will be available in the future


* While one person or one family may not be able to make a huge impact on the nation or the world, everyone can make a difference in their own corner of the world in their own way; foster care is one option for “making a difference”


* Most people in the community and/or the nation are unaware of the need for foster care families and the implications they can have on the life of one or more children in their lifetime


* America is the most prosperous nation in the world, yet we have a problem with the breakdown of family units resulting in a glut of children needing care.  If we can get on top of this problem in America we can then affect change in the rest of the world by providing assistance and resources where nations are not as prosperous and the need is potentially even greater


## Our Predictions


Using a regression analysis from SkLearn we have developed a model to predict what the foster care needs will be in 5, 10, and 20 years from now in selected states.  We will be looking at predicting the number of children in care as well as TPR predictions for the future (which can also be used to estimate group home needs for children that age out of the foster system without being adopted).  Our analysis also included predicting the number of adoptions by state as well.  We chose some Midwestern states as a start, but the analysis could be carried out by state for every state in the nation
